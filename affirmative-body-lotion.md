# affirmative-body-lotion

a brand dedicated to giving its user firm and desirable skin.

## affirmative body lotion

this brand is dedicated to positive enhancement of skin and is primarily targeting female consumers. its message is one of affirmation of the user, reinforcing that their body is a reflection of their beliefs about it -- and so is therefore intended to be a gradual improvement product; where over time their skin will improve, along with their thoughts and ideas about their body.

## affirmative action

this brand is kinda the opposite to the body lotion; it's also a lotion, but is primarily targeting male consumers. its message will be something to the effect of, (with this product) "it just works". it has the image of construction, building up, and getting things going. it just makes you feel better, look better, and is a sort of fix-all "duct tape" sort of product. the idea is, if you use it on your face, you look better, have a glow about you, and are more substantial in presence -- and if you use it on your chest, tighter skin makes you look stronger, more firm and direct -- and if you use it on your -- etc

## anything butt-smoothe

another alternate branding whos concept has no gender target, targeting neither an adult male or female consumer, but for anyone desiring youthful skin -- where this lotion promises it can make anything "as smooth as a baby's butt". emphasis in the image should be focused on youthfullness, softness, and bouncyness/jigglyness (like a baby's butt). no subtlety there.

### 2024-06-18 16:56 - quick thoughts

these ideas originally came to me last year when I was a bit blazed. I wrote them down and they just sorta sat on my computer. however today when talking to my neighbour about a different product idea, I was reminded of this one -- and so I decided I'd summarise the ideas. I have the implmentation of the concept pretty well figured out at this point, as I've come to understand what produces the glow, what alters the viscosity of fat, and a number of other concepts necessary to make such a product exist. I've also figured out how the vibration of hydrogen in the skin/fat is directly linked to our thoughts -- so every one of the products mentioned above -- though I presented them from an image and marketing perspective, are actually *real products*, which will perform as advertised. I'm probably also going to present the same idea to my neighbour's wife as well (see if she's interested in it).
