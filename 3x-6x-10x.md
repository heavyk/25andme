one of the things that I wish to eventually do is to take the *red star* out from the centre of the earth and take it with me. that'll leave earth just as it's outer shell/crust, which will work out just fine because the star inside will grow again (and eventually, it'll need to be taken out again). I'm not quite sure exactly what the consequences of that will be, but it could cause quite a difficulty for anyone with an X (and that's pretty much everyone -- cept a few bigfeet [you know what they say about big feet, right? big socks]). there's this one concept that I learned about from ben jonson in his masque of blackness, where he explains that black people are from a different solar regime. what I imagined he's explaining is that the body's X (not sure if it's the physical or the conceptual one) essentially stops working, and then when that happens, I'm pretty sure the sun takes over and gives them a symbolic (Y) replacement. when exploring this since I discovered that an X can either function as physical or conceptual, I noticed that there is a difference between a person with a physical X (pX) and a person with a conceptual X (cX), when it pairs with a Y because if the Y replaces the pX, then their physical reality is symbolic (ie, they take on the form that they imagine/reason/believe theirself to look like (like venus) and also all of their sensory experience (which would just be ordinary physical sensation) now also has meaning to it) and that's paired with a cX. other times, I've noticed a cX be replaced by a Y, and that's a weird one because all of a person's concepts are seemingly replaced by something symbolic, so they don't really feel their emotions, but instead reason about their emotions (I don't know for sure, but jaron kinda feels that way -- and I was like that a lot too before the haemorrhage) and so they're not really aware of their emotions in the *everything has a feel to it* sort of way (come to think of it, this could also be venus too) -- and that's paired with their physical system which instead tells them how things feel.
anyway, it seems to me entirely possible that when the sun comes to "save" the person by admitting them into their solar self, the skin turns black, because [oh wait, I just realised I have this backwards... the skin would stop being white when a person's concepts don't vibrate in the same astral(?) ranges as the sun does, and so therefore stops emitting light]. well, whether the skin turns black or not, doesn't matter -- but if I'm able to take the star out of earth and take it with me (off to some faraway place), then that's probably really bad for basically everyone. I have a solution though.
the other day I realised that since I'm going full primary (XXp XXc XX1) where both X in the pair vibrate exactly 180(degrees) offset from the carrier XX1 signal (something I'm not entirely sure how to do yet, because XX1 is going to also determine the position on the pen-rose and also be the emitter (everything else is going to be attraction/black)) -- thereby making that genetics perfect for someone like me who doesn't want to be doing any astral (where Xc is paired with Xp). so, what if someone who's XX, instead split their Xp and Xc into pairs like I did (3X), but did it twice (6X) instead, thereby making each X pair interact with the opposite X pair (ie XXc XXp XX1, XXp XXc XX1), where the physical and conceptual ones are next to each other, and the XX1s are also together (but 180(degrees apart in signal)) to each other.
then, it dawned on me: why not consider each X3 unit as a single "being" or self inside of the body (sorta like the R/L hemisphere), and then make a XX1 that will be sorta like the main clock signal and stablising force, and put X3 units in a triangle behind it (triforce) each at 120(degrees) offset from one another. X3 will be primary rays only, X6 will be astral between XXc and XXp, combined to form 2nd-ray relational perception in contrast to XX1 -- however the 10X will be something entirely new, because I have no idea how to perceive what a XXp XXc XX1 / XX1 XXp XXc / XXc XX1 XXp combo would look like all, because that's completely different. it's the difference between looking at everything on a grid (90(degrees) angles, and sharp edges) to looking at everything from a hexagonal perspective (60(degrees) angles, and gentle turns) -- or the difference between binary and trinary. it seems cool, and it could be really awesome. anyway, that could be pretty cool. also, there's the option of relacing one of the X pairs with YY or XY pair, but again I have no idea about that, at all.
